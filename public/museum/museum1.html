                Born to win, the young Weah developed his hard work ethic on the sandy beaches, dusty streets, and grassy fields of Liberia playing for teams such as the Young Survivors (1981-1984) and Bong Range United (1985). As early as 15, he assumed starring roles for Mighty Barrolle (1985–1986) and Invicible Eleven (1986–1987), where he became known as Oppong, liking his playing style of a Ghanaian football star.
