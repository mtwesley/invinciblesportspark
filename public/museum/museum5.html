                From Monaco, Weah took his talents to Paris Saint-Germain. There he won two more Coupe de France titles (1993, 1995) and, in 1994, the French League and African Footballer of the Year. He became the top scorer of the 1994-95 UEFA Champions League, including a glorious "wonder-goal" against Bayern Munich, where Weah dribbled past the entire opposing defense to score from the outskirts of the penalty box.
