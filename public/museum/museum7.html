                Nicknamed "African Pride" by the great Nelson Mandela, at his peak, Weah's finishing skills and powerful physique contributed to him becoming one of the best footballers in the world and the most decorated in Africa. Despite his god-like talents and impecable accuracy, he remained a thoughtful, strategic and well-disciplined player, having received only one red card throughout his entire professional career. 

            <br><br>
                In the latter stages of his sports career, Weah played for Chelsea and Manchester City (2000), Marseille (2000–2001) and Al Jazira (2001–2003). In 2004, Pele named him top of his FIFA 100 List of Greatest Living Players in the World and he earned an Eagle Award, a Nobel-style award, for his work as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.
