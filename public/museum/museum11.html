                In 2016, Weah announced his intention to run for President of Liberia again. This time around, he handedly defeated the incumbent party in both rounds with Joseph Boakai at its helm, winning every region with wide margins, apart from his competitor's home county, and gathering over 60% of the vote followed by months-long celebrations across the country.
